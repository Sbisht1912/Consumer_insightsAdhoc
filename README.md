Atliq Hardware: A financial and sales analysis Challenge Provide Insights to Management in the Consumer Goods Domain

Domain Consumer Goods | Function: Executive Management

Problem statement

Atliq Hardware (imaginary company) is one of the leading computer hardware producers in India and well expanded in other countries too. However, the management noticed that they do not get enough insights to make quick and smart data-informed decisions. Hence, the company decided to conduct an SQL challenge which will help them to understand the data. Task: Check ad-hoc-requests.pdf - there are 10 ad hoc requests for which the business needs insights. Need to run an SQL query to answer these requests. The target audience of this dashboard is top-level management - hence want to create a presentation to show the insights.
